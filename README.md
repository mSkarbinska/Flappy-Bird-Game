## About SFML - Simple and Fast Multimedia Library
Simple and Fast Multimedia Library (SFML) is a cross-platform software development library designed to provide a simple application programming interface (API) to various multimedia components in computers. It is written in C++ with bindings available for other languages.
SFML handles creating and input to windows, and creating and managing OpenGL contexts. This library is used heavily in making games and even game engines. And even though SFML doesnâ€™t support 3D rendering yet it is used for context creation.
